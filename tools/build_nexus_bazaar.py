"""Builds the Nexus Bazaar on the nexus map's south island.

    python tools/build_nexus_bazaar.py [--dry-run]

The nexus (`Exalt/Nexus New Auru.jm`) has a large sand island south of the town that nobody could
reach: the town's dock ends at Dark Water Flowing, which can't be walked on. This script
- builds a bridge from the dock to the island (over the unused Hallway region),
- lays a road from the bridge to the memorial plaza and paths to the market,
- builds open-air market pavilions whose stalls are shop regions (`Store N`, see
  `MerchantLists.Shops`), with pillars at their corners,
- and plants palm trees, lanterns and beach umbrellas on the open sand.

Every pavilion tile must be open sand, so a layout that runs into water or the plaza fails before
anything is written. The script refuses to run twice (it looks for the bazaar's `Store 11`
region); to change the layout, restore the map from git and run it again.
